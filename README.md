# Ruby Shell

A simple shell written in Ruby because why not!
I'm new to programing and did this in 6 hours. Enjoy

## Features

 - Broken History ~~only works as long as the shell session is running~~
 - Can run system commands! This is literally the most useful thing about it
 - Written in Ruby!
 - Did I fix the color?
 - Sample Text

## How to use

Just run
 `git clone  https://github.com/Stargirl-chan/ruby-shell.git`
 Change into that directory and run `./shell`

## Q&A

**Why?**
Because why not?

**Can I use this as my main shell?**
Are you a masochist?

**Are you planing on continuing this project?**
When I'm bored, yes

**Who asked these questions?**
Well I don't know

**How did you write this?**
These two sites helped me creating it:
[Writing a shell in 25 Lines of Ruby](https://www.rubyguides.com/2016/07/writing-a-shell-in-ruby/) and 
[A Unix shell in Ruby](https://www.jstorimer.com/blogs/workingwithcode/7766107-a-unix-shell-in-ruby)

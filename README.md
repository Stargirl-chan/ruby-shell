## Q&A

**Why?**
Because why not?

**Can I use this as my main shell?**
I don't see the point, but go ahead...

**Are you planing on continuing this project?**
If I have freetime, and the will to do so, then yes, if not, then no.

**Who asked these questions?**
No one. Literally.

**How did you write this?**
These two sites helped me creating it:
[Writing a shell in 25 Lines of Ruby](https://www.rubyguides.com/2016/07/writing-a-shell-in-ruby/) and 
[A Unix shell in Ruby](https://www.jstorimer.com/blogs/workingwithcode/7766107-a-unix-shell-in-ruby)
